## FAQ

question | answer
:-------------------------|:-------------------------
do i need to keep the app open? | no, deselecting servers will block them permanently until you select them again
how do i uninstall? | click the `unblock` button and then delete the `.exe`
does this app install anything? | this app is a portable `.exe` file and does not install anything
how do i update this app? | an update button should appear when an update is available
does this app have a virus? | no, all the source code is above and `dropship.exe` is generated [here](https://github.com/stowmyy/dropship/actions)
does this app support `tunneling`? | yes, `tunneling` is enabled by default and configurable in `options`
what is `tunneling`? | `tunneling` makes sure servers are blocked per-application instead of globally. `tunneling` prevents servers in other games and apps from becoming unintentionally blocked
how do i pin this app to my taskbar? | <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a0cf3cf5-4b24-4ee5-b893-b95a73b9e75b" height="90" />
does this app modify the game? | this app does **_not_** modify the game in any way. instead, this app works by adding windows firewall rules that block certain servers just like an ad blocker would
