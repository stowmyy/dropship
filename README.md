## notes
- use this app to control which ow2 servers you play on
- **my simple use case:** when i want to play on na west coast, i block na east coast. i don't block any other servers
 
## how to use
1. download and open the app. it's a portable `.exe` file and doesn't install anything.
2. select the servers you wish to block. that's it, read the warnings section.
   - you do not need to keep the app open once servers are blocked.
3. if you block certain servers, **they will remain blocked forever** until you unblock them

## is it safe?
- this program is safe. **read the warnings** and nothing bad will happen.
- all the source code is above and the `.exe` is automatically generated [here](https://github.com/stowmyy/dropship-test/actions).
  - you can compile it yourself too, since it's open source.

## warnings
1. <ins>**do not queue with other people unless they have the same servers blocked as you do**</ins>
   - you may connect to a server you have blocked and time out unless you open this app and unblock it
2. <ins>**if you are connecting to a server for longer than 5 seconds:**</ins>
   - _quickly_ open this app and unblock servers or you will time out and disconnect
   - if this happens please let me know on twitter so i can fix it - it means the ow2 servers were changed and i have to update the app.
   - this bug has not happened to me in a very long time but you always must remember to do this or you will get disconnected and a temporary competitive ban

#### HOW TO HELP
  - If you ever get DC'd you can help by letting me know through [discord](https://discord.stormy.gg/) or [twitter](https://twitter.stormy.gg/) and i'll push a hotfix
  - Please ask questions and give suggestions there too

## acknowledgements
- [foryVERX/Overwatch-Server-Selector](https://github.com/foryVERX/Overwatch-Server-Selector/)
  - please also take a look at this program. it is very similar but is more battle tested and has a community around it.
  - they did all the hard work for finding server ips. i just wanted to make my own version that was more lightweight and portable.
