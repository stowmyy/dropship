## disconnect warnings
1. **do not queue with other people** unless they have the same servers blocked as you do
2. keep in mind this app does also affect **unranked** and **custom games**

## if you are having trouble connecting
   - _quickly_ open this app and unblock servers or you may time out and disconnect
     - this _should_ never happen if you follow the warnings but please keep it in mind or you may get disconnected and recieve a temporary competitive ban
   - blocking OW2 servers can unintentionally affect other games. a fix is being worked on and will be available in a future update

how do i update this app? | this app updates automatically when you open it
